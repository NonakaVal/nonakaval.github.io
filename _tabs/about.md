Hey, I’m Valdenir Nonaka. 
I’m into data, automation, and figuring out how to organize pretty much anything. Whether it’s work, projects, or just my own curiosity. After years of keeping my notes to myself, I finally decided to share what I’ve been learning. If you're into productivity, knowledge management, and tools like Obsidian, you’ll feel right at home on my YouTube channel.

Like the title says, I'm not a dev—just love seeing how far open-source can go and starting to believe that humanity isn’t entirely doomed in the process.
